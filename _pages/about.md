I’m a third-year PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Economics at the University of Zurich (UZH)</a>, supported by a PhD scholarship from the University Research Priority Program (URPP) <a href="https://www.urpp-equality.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equality of Opportunity</a>.

My research interests span a wide range of topics in **public and labor economics across low-, middle, and high-income countries**. I am currently working on projects that focus on social insurances, tax incidence, or labor regulations. I'm always happy to talk about research - feel free to get in touch!

Before joining UZH, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow to Prof. Camille Landais at the London School of Economics (LSE), where I contributed to the following two papers: <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w31080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealth and Property Taxation in the United States (Dray, Landais, Stantcheva, NBER WP 31080)</a>  and <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taxing Top Wealth: Migration Responses and their Aggregate Economic Implications (Jakobsen, Kleven, Kolsrud, Landais, Muñoz, NBER WP 32153)</a>.

I hold both a BSc and an MSc in Economics from the University of Mannheim, where I also worked as a research assistant to Ass. Prof. Arthur Seibold, contributing to the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA18911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unwilling to Train? - Firm Responses to the Colombian Apprenticeship Regulation (Caicedo, Espinosa, Seibold, Econometrica (2022))</a>.
