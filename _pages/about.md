I’m a third-year PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Economics at the University of Zurich (UZH)</a>, supported by a PhD scholarship from the University Research Priority Program (URPP) <a href="https://www.urpp-equality.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equality of Opportunity</a>.

My research interests span a wide range of topics in public and labor economics. 

Before joining UZH, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow with Prof. Camille Landais at the London School of Economics (LSE).

I hold both a BSc and MSc in Economics from the University of Mannheim, where I also worked as a research assistant to Ass. Prof. Arthur Seibold.
